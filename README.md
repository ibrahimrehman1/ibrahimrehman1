## Hi I'm Ibrahim 👋


I am a student currently doing a Bachelor's in Computer and Information Systems Engineering from NED University of Engineering and Technology. I recently began to be fascinated by Web Programming, so I decided to start my career in Web Development currently, focusing on the front-end side. My goal is to become a professional Full-Stack Web Developer. I am also conversant in using Adobe Photoshop for my projects. I am therefore looking for a job or an internship as a Front-end developer so that I can further hone my Web Development skills.
