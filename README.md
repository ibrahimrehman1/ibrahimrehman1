## Hi I'm Ibrahim ðŸ‘‹


I am a student currently doing a Bachelor's in **Computer and Information Systems Engineering from NED University of Engineering and Technology**. I recently began to be fascinated by Web Programming, so I decided to start my career in Web Development, currently focusing on the Back End side. My goal is to become a professional **Full-Stack Web Developer**.  I am conversant in using the following technologies for my projects:

âœ” HTML 5
âœ” CSS 3
âœ” Javascript
âœ” JQuery
âœ” Bootstrap 4
âœ” ReactJS
